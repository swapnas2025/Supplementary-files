Introduction

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection and accurate classification of lung cancer from CT images can significantly improve patient outcomes. 
In this work, we employ an advanced deep ensemble learning model combined with Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) to optimize hyperparameters for effective lung cancer detection.

This document provides a step-by-step explanation of the implementation of our approach using Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn.

Implementation steps

# Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries
This methos begin by importing the necessary libraries, including NumPy, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn for machine learning operations. 
The Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) module is used to optimize hyperparameters.

mport numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, matthews_corrcoef, confusion_matrix
from cat_swarm_optimization import CatSwarmOptimizer  # Assumes a CSO library or custom implementation
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50, VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
This step involves resizing the CT images to a standard size (224x224 pixels) for compatibility with pre-trained
 deep learning models. The images are then normalized and split into training and testing datasets.
def preprocess_data(images, labels):
    images_resized = [tf.image.resize(img, (224, 224)) for img in images]
    images_normalized = np.array(images_resized) / 255.0
    return train_test_split(images_normalized, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Load CT dataset
images, labels = load_ct_images_and_labels()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = preprocess_data(images, labels)

# Step 3: Feature Extraction using Pre-Trained Models
This method uses pre-trained deep learning models (ResNet50 and VGG16) as feature extractors. 
These models have been trained on large image datasets and can effectively extract meaningful features from CT images.

def create_base_model(base_model_name):
    if base_model_name == "ResNet50":
        base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
    elif base_model_name == "VGG16":
        base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
    x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(base_model.output)
    x = Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
    output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)
    return Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=output)

# Step 4: Deep Ensemble Learning
Next to  create an ensemble of deep learning models, which allows us to combine their strengths and improve overall classification performance.

models = [create_base_model("ResNet50"), create_base_model("VGG16")]

# Step 5: Hyperparameter Optimization using Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO)
Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) is an optimization algorithm inspired by the behavior of cats.
 We use CSO to find the best hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, to improve the performance of our ensemble model.

def fitness_function(hyperparams):
    # Define training pipeline using the hyperparameters
    # Return validation accuracy as the fitness score
    pass

cso = CatSwarmOptimizer(fitness_function, num_cats=30, num_iterations=50)
best_hyperparams = cso.optimize()

# Step 6: Train the Deep Ensemble Model with Optimized Hyperparameters
Each model in our ensemble is trained using the optimized hyperparameters determined by CSO. The Adam optimizer is used for efficient gradient updates.

for model in models:
    model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=best_hyperparams['learning_rate']),
                  loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=best_hyperparams['epochs'], batch_size=best_hyperparams['batch_size'], validation_split=0.2)

# Step 7: Evaluate the Ensemble Model
The predictions from all models in the ensemble are averaged to obtain a final prediction. 
Standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) are used to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.

def ensemble_predict(models, X):
    predictions = [model.predict(X) for model in models]
    return np.mean(predictions, axis=0)

y_pred = ensemble_predict(models, X_test) > 0.5
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
mcc = matthews_corrcoef(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}, Precision: {precision}, Recall: {recall}, F1-Score: {f1}, MCC: {mcc}")
